# OWASP [ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) Image For OpenShift

## Overview
The public docker registry version of OWASP's Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is not
compatible with OpenShift without using privleged containers. This
Docker image resolves that issue.

## Running

The semantics of running this are identical to the public OWASP ZAP docker
image, so look at the Wiki page [HERE](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Docker).
